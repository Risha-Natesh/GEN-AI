Dear Volunteers,
I hope you are all doing well. As the Vice President of our NSS unit, I am glad to announce that we will be hosting our NSS Sports Event on 18th (Sunday) at the Campus Ground. I will be overseeing all the events, and to ensure smooth coordination, the following members have been assigned as event coordinators:

	• Kabaddi – Rohan M.
	• Throwball – Sneha K.
	• 100m Sprint – Aditya P.
	
Each coordinator will be responsible for managing their sport completely—this includes arranging equipment, organizing participant names, handling refreshments, and ensuring the overall flow of the event. I request all volunteers to cooperate with your respective coordinators and extend full support throughout the day.

Your participation and teamwork are essential for making this event successful. Looking forward to an energetic and well-coordinated sports day.

Warm regards,
RISHA NATESH
