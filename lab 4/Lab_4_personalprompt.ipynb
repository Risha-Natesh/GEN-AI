If we are talking about cookies as discrete units, selling 75% might mean 562 were sold, or it might imply a fraction of a cookie is accounted for until a whole number is reached. For simplicity and consistency in math problems, let's re-evaluate: if 562.5 were 'sold', it means 562 were sold *and* half of another cookie. If the question implies whole cookies, then this step needs clarification. However, for calculation purposes, let's proceed with 562.5 sold.\n",

If the problem strictly implies whole cookies, then the wording about selling 75% might need to be interpreted as \"sell 75% of the *total amount*, rounded down to the nearest whole cookie if necessary for the *number of units sold*\".\n",

Since a baker cannot have half a cookie at the end, it's most logical to round down to the nearest whole cookie that is *complete and unburnt*. Alternatively, if 75% *means* they sold 562 whole cookies, then the first calculation was right.

It hosts several sub-temples with beautiful Zen gardens and often much fewer tourists. Specifically, **Daisen-in** and **Koto-in** offer profound cultural experiences and stunning gardens.\n",
        "*   **Higashiyama District (side streets and early visits):** Beyond the main tourist path, wander through the narrow streets early in the morning to find traditional machiya houses, small craft shops, and local tea houses. Visit **Kodai-ji Temple** for its beautiful rock garden and bamboo grove, which is less frequented than Kiyomizu-dera.\n",

        "For a truly unique cultural experience, consider a traditional tea ceremony in a less commercialized setting, or look for local artisan workshops where you can try your hand at crafts like pottery or dyeing.

        "The overall process successfully demonstrated various prompting techniques for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs), highlighting their practical applications and differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Persona Prompting:** This technique was illustrated by creating a detailed persona, \"Chef Zorp, the Galactic Ambassador of Interstellar Gastronomy.\" A prompt was then crafted to assign this persona to the LLM, resulting in a response that consistently adopted Chef Zorp's eccentric and food-related terminology, even re-interpreting Earth ingredients with alien-themed names (e.g., \"Gravitational Greens\" for spinach).\n",
        "*   **Cognitive Verifier Prompting:** This was demonstrated using a complex multi-step word problem involving a baker's cookies. The prompt explicitly instructed the LLM to perform step-by-step reasoning, provide an initial solution, and then verify it. The example response showcased the LLM's ability to identify and address ambiguities (such as fractional cookies when calculating 75% of sales), leading to a self-corrected and verified final answer of 268 unburnt cookies.\n",
        "*   **Question Refinement:** This technique showed how an initial broad question (\"What are the best places to visit in Japan?\") yielded a general LLM response. A subsequent refined question, incorporating specific interests (traditional culture, temples, avoiding crowds in Kyoto), led to a highly detailed and actionable response, including recommendations for specific, less-crowded areas and unique cultural experiences.\n",
        "*   **Providing Information and Asking Questions:** This illustrated how an LLM can accurately answer questions solely based on provided context. An example news snippet about \"Acme Corporation's 'Quantum Leaper 3000'\" served as context, and the LLM successfully extracted precise details like the release date of October 26, 2023, and the 40% data processing speed enhancement, adhering strictly to the given information.\n",
        "*   **Retrieve, Generate, Critique/Consolidate (RGC) Approach:** The explanation detailed a structured, multi-turn prompting framework. It outlined the purpose and provided example prompts for each phase: 'Retrieve' (e.g., \"Summarize key information\"), 'Generate' (e.g., \"Draft an initial report using retrieved information\"), and 'Critique/Consolidate' (e.g., \"Review generated report for accuracy and suggest improvements\"), emphasizing iterative refinement.\n",
        "*   **Zero-shot, One-shot, and Few-shot Prompting:**\n",
        "    *   **Zero-shot:** Demonstrated classification of sentence sentiment (\"Positive\") without any prior examples.\n",
        "    *   **One-shot:** Showed translation (English to French for \"Goodbye\") with a single guiding example.\n",
        "    *   **Few-shot:** Illustrated entity and type extraction with three examples, enabling the LLM to correctly identify \"Google\" as a \"Company\" from a new sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Tailor Prompting Techniques to Task Complexity:** The choice of prompting technique (e.g., zero-shot for simple classification, chain-of-thought for complex reasoning, RGC for comprehensive content creation) significantly impacts the quality and accuracy of LLM outputs. Understanding the nuances of each technique allows for more efficient and effective interaction with LLMs.\n",
        "*   **Emphasize Iterative Refinement and Verification:** Techniques like Cognitive Verifier and the Critique/Consolidate phase of RGC are crucial for improving LLM reliability. Incorporating explicit instructions for self-correction and factual verification helps mitigate errors and ensures higher-quality, more trustworthy results, especially for critical tasks.\n"
